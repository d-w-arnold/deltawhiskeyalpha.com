                Security for the Post-Quantum world"</a>. This project set out to survey the field of quantum
            cryptography, providing a basic insight into various aspects of quantum cryptography - all of which could be
            very important regarding our online security in the future! Aimed at computer scientists and people in
            industry concerned with security.</p>

    <p class="title">About Me</p>

    <div class="writing roboto">

        <p>Before I became a computer scientist, I was a golfer. Growing up my grandfather lived near a golf club and
            bought me my first set of golf clubs for my 7th birthday. By the age of 19, I had brought my golfing
            handicap down from 28 to -1. Over the years I represented <a class="link-color" target="_blank"
                                                                         href="https://www.kentgolf.org/">Kent County
                Golf Union</a> in various fixtures for their various teams: Kent Under 13's, Under 14's, Under 16's
            (Captain), Under 18's.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In January 2016, I relinquished my amateur status and turned professional (aged 19) joining the <a
                    class="link-color" target="_blank" href="http://www.europrotour.com/">EuroPro UK Golf Tour</a> for
            the 2016 season. In August 2016, I hung up my golf clubs to turn my attention to undergraduate study in
            Computer Science at the <a class="link-color" target="_blank" href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/">University of
                Kent</a>. Golf remains a passion of mine, and will remain a lifetime hobby.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Motorsport is a strong passion of mine. I have a broad knowledge of various disciplines of motor racing, and
            I enjoy learning of new technological developments to make cars faster, safer and more efficient at speed. I
            enjoy the thrill of driving on track, having invested in multiple track day sessions with tuition from
            professional racing drivers to better my skill set.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Running used to be a big part of my regular training routine for golf. When I can I find it helps take things
            off ones mind and keep the body healthy. I participated in a half marathon in September 2016 and hope to do
            more half and full marathons in the future. I especially enjoy long runs along the coast.</p>
