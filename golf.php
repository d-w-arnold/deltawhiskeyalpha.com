        <p>Before I became a Computer Scientist, I was a golfer. My golf career started at the age of 7. My grandfather, who lived next to Littlestone Golf Club (Kent, U.K.), bought me my first set of golf clubs for my 7th birthday. As a beginning amateur, I earned myself a handicap of 28 at the age of 8, and by the age of 19, I had brought that down to -1. Over the years I represented Kent County Golf Union in various fixtures for their various teams: Kent Under 13’s, U14’s, U16’s (Captain), U18’s.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In January 2016, I relinquished my amateur status and turned professional (aged 19) joining the EuroPro UK Golf Tour for the 2016 season. In August 2016, I hung up my golf clubs professionally in order to turn my attention to an unconditional offer for undergraduate study in Computer Science at the University of Kent. Golf remains a passion of mine, and will remain a lifetime hobby.</p>
