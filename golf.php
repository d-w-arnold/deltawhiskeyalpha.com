    <p>Before I became a Computer Scientist, I was a golfer.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My golf career started at the age of 7.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My grandfather, who used to live next to Littlestone Golf Club (Kent, England), bought me my first set of golf clubs for my 7th birthday.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As a beginner amateur, I earned myself a handicap of 28 at the age of 8, and over the course of the next 11 years, I brought that down to -1.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In January 2015, I ventured to Newberry, South Carolina (USA) to study and play golf for the Newberry College NCAA golf team - I was scouted by their head coach, and was offered 100% sporting and academic scholarship, to both train and play for the team and to study as a Mathematics Major.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In October 2016, I relinquished my amateur status and turned professional in January 2016 (aged 19) and joined the EuroPro UK Golf Tour for the 2016 season.</p>
    <br>
    <p>During the EuroPro qualifying stages in March 2016, I was struck with illness and was limited in my ability to qualify for a high ranking position on the tour - making it difficult to enter events (due to limited spaces per event) for the remainder of the year.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In August 2016, I decided to hang up my golf clubs professionally in order to turn my attention to an unconditional offer for undergraduate study in Computer Science at the University of Kent.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Golf remains a passion of mine, and will remain a lifetime hobby.</p>
