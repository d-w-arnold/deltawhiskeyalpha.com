        <p>Before I became a Computer Scientist, I was a golfer. My golf career started at the age of 7. My grandfather, who lived next to <a class="link-color" target="_blank" href="https://www.littlestonegolfclub.org.uk/">Littlestone Golf Club</a> (Kent, U.K.), bought me my first set of golf clubs for my 7th birthday. As a beginning amateur, I earned myself a handicap of 28 at the age of 8, and by the age of 19, I had brought that down to -1. Over the years I represented <a class="link-color" target="_blank" href="https://www.kentgolf.org/">Kent County Golf Union</a> in various fixtures for their various teams: Kent Under 13’s, U14’s, U16’s (Captain), U18’s.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In January 2016, I relinquished my amateur status and turned professional (aged 19) joining the <a class="link-color" target="_blank" href="http://www.europrotour.com/">EuroPro UK Golf Tour</a> for the 2016 season. In August 2016, I hung up my golf clubs professionally in order to turn my attention to an unconditional offer for undergraduate study in Computer Science at the <a class="link-color" target="_blank" href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/">University of Kent</a>. Golf remains a passion of mine, and will remain a lifetime hobby.</p>
